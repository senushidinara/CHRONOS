        "Based on the inspection, the extracted files are primarily CSV files located within subdirectories organized by track and race. There are also macOS resource fork files (prefixed with ._). The plan is to identify and read the relevant CSV files into pandas DataFrames, ignoring the macOS files. Then, based on the file names, it appears the data includes lap times, telemetry, weather, and race results. A logical next step for data analysis would be to explore these different data sources, potentially merge them based on common columns like lap number, and then perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the combined data to understand race performance, weather impacts, etc. Since the specific analysis is not defined, the plan will be to load the data and provide an overview of the available information.\n",
